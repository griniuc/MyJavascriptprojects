          The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose
          native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the
          Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is
          a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak
          bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi).[5] A boar (adult male) weighs around
          350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb),[6] while a sow (adult female) is about half
          that size. Polar bears are the largest land carnivores currently in
          existence, rivaled only by the Kodiak bear.[7] Although it is the
          sister species of the brown bear,[8] it has evolved to occupy a
          narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for
          cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for
          hunting seals, which make up most of its diet.[9] Although most polar
          bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice.
          Their scientific name means "maritime bear" and derives from this
          fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of
          sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present.
          Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified
          as marine mammals.[10]
